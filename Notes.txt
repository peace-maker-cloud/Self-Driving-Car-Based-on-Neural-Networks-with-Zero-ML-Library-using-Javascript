1) About car physics..

I have done car Model using 2d context designed to control using arrow keys. 

2) About road generations

we used the linear interpolation method to create the road lanes
LINEAR INTERPOLATION is a form of interpolation, which involves the generation of new values based on an existing set of values
Explanation:
    Linear interpolation is achieved by geometrically rendering a straight line between two adjacent points on a graph or plane. All points on the line other than the original two can be considered interpolated values.

3) About Sensors

We have Created the Artificial sensor and detect the border  using Segment Intersection method.

4) About Collisions

Now we have done upto artificial sensor in our car model 
it's time for collision detection..
We are going to make traffic to make this scenario realtime..
small traffic has been created and let's make it to interact with car model Sensors
Now the car gets damage if it contact with any objects.
We have successfully created a mini traffic an damage collision using polyIntersection and Segment Intersection Method

5) About Neural Networks 

Artificial Neural Networks...
    what is Neural Networks?
        Neural Networks are computing system inspried by the biological neural Networks in our brain.
        It will work just like how our neurons and axons do.
    Neural Networks has three layers
    1 : Input Layer
            This is where we put our input values
    2 : Hidden Layer
            why we say this hidden because it may contains more than one layers to process our input.
    3 : Output Layer
            After the process done in hidden layer, we finally get our output from this layer.
    We are setting biased and weight values between -1 to 1 because if front sensor detects a car, it should turn to avoid collision. but, it doesn't know which direction it needs to go if it has border on right side so it need to take the left.
